# Installing Dependencies

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Run the installation script:
```batch
install_online_fix_requirements.bat
```

This will install all required dependencies for the multiplayer fix feature.

## Manual Install

If you prefer to install manually:

```batch
pip install httpx beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

## What Gets Installed

- **httpx** - Modern HTTP client for making web requests
- **beautifulsoup4** - HTML parsing library
- **lxml** - Fast XML/HTML parser (backend for BeautifulSoup)

## Why These Dependencies?

The multiplayer fix feature uses HTTP requests to download fixes from online-fix.me. These libraries enable:

- Direct HTTP communication (no browser needed)
- HTML parsing to find download links
- Fast and reliable downloads

## No Chrome/Selenium Needed!

The new implementation **does not require**:
- ❌ Chrome browser
- ❌ ChromeDriver
- ❌ Selenium
- ❌ webdriver-manager

This makes the feature:
- ✅ Faster
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Easier to use
- ✅ Lighter on resources

## Verifying Installation

To verify the dependencies are installed correctly:

```python
python -c "import httpx; import bs4; print('All dependencies installed!')"
```

If you see "All dependencies installed!", you're good to go!

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'httpx'"
Run: `pip install httpx`

### "No module named 'bs4'"
Run: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

### "No module named 'lxml'"
Run: `pip install lxml`

### pip not found
Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH.

## Building EXE

After installing dependencies, rebuild the EXE:

```batch
build_simple.bat
```

The new EXE will include all dependencies and work without Chrome/ChromeDriver.
