# SMD User Guide - How to Use

## Menu Navigation

You might find it difficult to navigate the menu options, so here's what each one does.

### Process a .lua file
The main functionality of SMD. It goes through 8 steps:

**1. Input Methods**
- Add a .lua file: Manually import a .lua file that you own
- Choose from saved .lua files: Every .lua file you add gets saved by SMD, you can find them again through here (usually to update games)
- Automatically download a .lua file: Automatically download a .lua file from either manilua or oureveryday

**2. GreenLuma Achievement Toggle via Registry**
"Would you like Greenluma (normal mode) to track achievements?"

GreenLuma is able to track achievements and store them in the registry. Afaik, they can only be viewed by using external apps like Achievement Watcher (You have to use darktakayanagi's fork for GL2025 support). If you want to only run this part, there's always the original method via GreenLumaSettings_2025.exe

**3. Adding AppList IDs**
IDs from the .lua file get added to the AppList folder

**4. DLC Check**
(Check DLC section)

**5. Config VDF Writing**
Decryption keys from each depot get added to config.vdf

**6. Lua Backup**
.lua file gets saved to the 'saved_lua' folder

**7. ACF Writing**
".acf file found. Are you updating a game..."
Creates/overwrites .acf file for the game. These files basically track the state of a game. You usually don't need to overwrite but it's there just in case.

**8. Manifest Downloading**
The manifest is downloaded, and then moved to the depotcache folder. It used to also decrypt but that's been moved to the (Manifest downloads only) mode, since it's unnecessary.

### Process a .lua file (Manifest downloads only)
Basically like the first one, but it only does the .lua file input and backup, and manifest downloads. This also has an extra prompt that asks if you'd like to move these manifest files to a different folder or not. This option does not show up by default. You'll have to enable Advanced Mode in settings.

### Check DLC status of a game
There are two types of DLC. Ones that have a depot and ones that don't. SMD calls them DOWNLOAD REQUIRED and PRE-INSTALLED respectively.

- For DOWNLOAD REQUIRED, you'll need to find a .lua that contains keys for that DLC
- For PRE-INSTALLED, all you need to do is allow SMD to add them to your AppList folder

### Crack a game (gbe_fork)
Basically disconnects a game from Steam so it can run independently. Can also track achievements, and has its own in-game overlay UI.

### Remove SteamStub DRM (Steamless)
Some games will fail to run because of this DRM, run this to fix that.

### Download UserGameStatsSchema (achievements w/o gbe_fork)
Uncracked games can use Steam's actual achievement system locally. Use this to create the files needed for that to work. You can view your achievements in the library UI and in-game, but you do need to run Steam in Offline Mode.

### Offline Mode Fix
GreenLuma has a bug where if you launch Steam while in Offline Mode, it gets stuck. Use this to fix that.

### Manage AppList IDs
You can view and delete IDs that have been added to the AppList folder here.

### Patch / Unpatch Steam (DLL)
On Windows, SMD can patch Steam so it reads the game data SMD prepares (Lua files and related folders) without replacing Steam. The two files (xinput1_4.dll and hid.dll) are included in the steam_patch folder. Choose this menu option and pick "Patch Steam". To remove the patch, choose "Unpatch Steam" and restart Steam.

### Check for updates
You can update SMD using this. It's a bit funky though.

### Install/Uninstall Context Menu
You can immediately access SMD through right-clicking a .lua/.zip file. This just launches SMD immediately into the Process a .lua file section, along with the file you right-clicked.

### Settings
You can change settings set by SMD here. They usually get set automatically as you use SMD.
