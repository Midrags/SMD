# DLC Unlockers

SMD can install DLC unlockers for Steam and some Ubisoft games. That lets you use extra content (DLC) in a way that works with how the game is installed.

**How to use it**

From the main menu, choose the option that opens the DLC Unlockers or CreamInstaller-style menu. Then pick the game and the unlocker you want (for example SmokeAPI or CreamAPI for Steam games). SMD will download the needed files if required and install them into the game folder. You may need to choose which DLC to unlock; the menu will guide you.

**What SMD supports**

For Steam games, SMD can install SmokeAPI or CreamAPI (and optionally Koaloader). For Ubisoft games it can install unlockers for older and newer Ubisoft Connect. The exact options depend on your SMD version and the game.

**Credits**

The DLC Unlockers feature in SMD is inspired by and compatible with CreamInstaller. Credit: CreamInstaller. SMD does not ship CreamInstaller; it provides its own implementation that follows similar behavior.

**Responsibility**

Use DLC unlockers only for games and DLC you are allowed to use. SMD is a tool; you are responsible for how you use it.

For more on SMD in general, see the main [documentation](../README.md).
